## So you want to change your badge image?
It's really simple, trust me.

You're gonna want to need [an image converter](https://fconvert.com/image/), [thonny](https://thonny.org), and any image you want, preferrably a square one so it looks better, but if you're fine with it being stretched out/squished, that's fine.

First, hook up your badge to your computer and open Thonny. You're gonna wanna choose **MicroPython (ESP23)** out of the following options.

Then, you're going to want to go to your image conversion website and make your image **240 by 240** pixels, download that and move it to your ```BSidesFW2025Badge-main``` folder anywhere that'd be most convenient to locate in Thonny. In this case for me, it's ``konata.jpg``

After doing this, you need to open ``MicroPython device/img`` and delete ``bsides_logo.jpg`` in that folder. This is when my wording gets slightly confusing, but after deleting that image file, you need to rename your image file in the badge folder on your computer to bsides_logo.jpg, right click it, and press "Upload to /img". Once it's uploaded, you'll need to unplug and restart your badge, and if done correctly you should have something like this!

This image is from earlier today, it's a different character from when I first got the image to work, as of writing I'm having difficulties but I also went in and modified more things...

Ask me if anything goes wrong and I'll go through the process again and update it, but this is the simplest way I can word it in my opinion while still being a little detailed. Again thank you Steve, Stephen & Luke for the help!!!!
